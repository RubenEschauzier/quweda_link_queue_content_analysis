In the LTQP literature there is limited existing research into link prioritization approaches. The research that does exist focuses on querying the entire web of linked data and does not assume any structural properities of the distributed environment. We will discuss graph-based [](cite:cites hartig2016walking), intermediate solution-based [](cite:cites hartig2016walking), and string similarity-based algorithms [](cite:cites lynden2013hybrid).
