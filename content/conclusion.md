## Conclusion
{:#Conclusion}

In this paper, we investigate the contents of the link queue during LTQP over SOLID pods. Based on the content of the link queue during query execution, we divide queries into two types. The first query type (type one) has a primarily empty link queue during query execution. In contrast, the second query type (type two) has a link queue that fills excessively and cannot be emptied by the query engine. For queries with full link queues, we find that the link queue mainly fills up with links retrieved using cMatch. 
For type one queries, the bottleneck is their query execution plan. This bottleneck shows that improving existing zero-knowledge query planning is required to optimize LTQP over the Solid environment. On the other hand, type two queries highlight that link prioritization has merit in obtaining faster results and that the cMatch criterion is not sufficiently selective for efficient LTQP. Based on our analysis, we conclude that future work on LTQP for SOLID has three major avenues for research. First, we should investigate different query optimization algorithms, like adaptive query planning. Secondly, link prioritization can decrease query result arrival times and thus improve application responsiveness. Finally, we should investigate possible alternatives to using the cMatch criterion to discover new SOLID pods as it is insufficiently selective and causes the link queue to overflow.
