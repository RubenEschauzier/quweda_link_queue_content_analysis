## Conclusion
{:#Conclusion}

In this paper, we investigate the contents of the link queue during LTQP over SOLID pods. We find that queries can roughly be divided into two categories, one where the link queue is mostly empty during query execution and the other where the queue fills up quickly and the query engine can not process them quickly enough. For queries with full link queues, we find that the link queue mainly fills up with links retrieved using cMatch. Queries where the link queue is empty showcase the need for algorithms that improve the query execution plan in LTQP, which are currently lacking due to the minimal prior knowledge available on the data. On the other hand, queries with full link queues highlight that link prioritisation has merit in obtaining faster result, and that the cMatch criterion is not sufficiently selective for efficient LTQP. Based on our analysis, we conclude that future work on LTQP for SOLID has three major avenues for research. First, we should investigate different query optimization algorithsm, like adaptive query planning. Secondly, link prioritisation can decrease query result arrival times and thus improve application responsiveness. Finally, we should investigate possible alternatives to using the cMatch criterion to discover new SOLID pods as it is insufficiently selective and causes the link queue to overflow.
