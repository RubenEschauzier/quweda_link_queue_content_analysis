## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Link Traversal-based Query Processing (LTQP) is a decentralized querying approach that requires no prior information on the location of data sources.
LTQP iteratively follows links found in dereferenced data to discover data sources to query.

<!-- Context      -->
Link Traversal-based Query Processing (LTQP) is a decentralized querying approach that iteratively follows links at runtime to discover data sources to query.
Given the dynamic nature of source discovery, query processing tends to be relatively slow.
<!-- Need         -->
Optimization techniques exist, such as exploiting existing structural information, but they depend on aÂ deep understanding of the link queue during LTQP.
<!-- Task         -->
To this end,
we investigated the evolution of the types of link sources in the link queue,
and introduce a metric for link queue source type diversity during query execution.
<span class="comment" data-author="RV">Assuming that diversity is good or bad here? Be explicit, because I genuinely don't know ðŸ™‚</span>
